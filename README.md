Projects 1 - 4


Project 1: Program Description: The program below acts as the following. Its job is to read in the
employee information from a text file line by line, and each line will represent the
following types of employees: Employee, Salesman, and Executive. The year will be the
first date element on the line, which will display either 2014 or 2015. After the date
the employee type followed by their name, and monthly salary. However, for the Salesman
their final value is annual sales, and for Executive their final value is stock price.
Each employee type will have an employee object that is created for their type, and
will be stored in one of two arrays depending upon the year. We can assume that the file
will not contain any more then 10 employees. Once all employee data in read in based on 
year, each line will contain original data supplied for each employee followed by the 
annual salary for that year. Lastly, for each of the two years an average salary will be
calculated and displayed.


Project 2: The ATM class creates the ATM Graphical User Interface and has the following properties:
 		*  	imports from java.awt and java.swing
 		*  	extends JFrame and implements ActionListener
Creates the ATM Constructor which implements:
 		*  	creates 4 buttons:  withdraw, deposit, transfer and balance
 		*  	creates 2 radial button: checking and savings
 		*  	creates a test field for user numeric input
 		*  The Account class also catches various exceptions with custom defined messages displayed in a message block
 		*  The ATM class calls the Account class which contains corresponding methods which handled the
 		*  action performed by each button.
    
    
Project 3: involves writing a program to calculate the terms of the following sequence of numbers: 0 1 2 5 12 29 ... where 
each term of the sequence is twice the previous term plus the second previous term.The 0th term of the sequence is 0 and the
1st term of the sequence is 1. 


Project 4: involves writing a program to manage a students records in a database.
